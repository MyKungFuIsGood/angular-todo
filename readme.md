## Read Me

A todolist built off of the Laravel framework and AngularJS.

Documentation for the entire Laravel framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

Documentation for the entire AngularJS framework can be found on the [AngularJS website](https://docs.angularjs.org/api).

Laravel blade templating has been changed to use '[[', ']]' so that it will not conflict with Angular.

Bower packages needed are:
	bower install angularjs
	bower install angular-ui-sortable
	bower install bootstrap
